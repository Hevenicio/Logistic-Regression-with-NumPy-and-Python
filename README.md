## Project Description
The objective of this project is to implement the entire mechanism, including lowering the gradient, cost function and logistic regression, of the various learning algorithms, to obtain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

The project was carried out according to the following steps:

- Task 1: Introduction and Project Overview,
- Task 2: Load the Data and Import Libraries,
- Task 3: Visualize the Data,
- Task 4: Define the Logistic Sigmoid Function 𝜎(𝑧),
- Task 5: Compute the Cost Function J(𝜃) and Gradient,
- Task 6: Cost and Gradient at Initialization,
- Task 7: Implement Gradient Descent from Scratch,
- Task 8: Plotting the Convergence of J(𝜃),
- Task 9: Plotting the Decision Boundary,
- Task 10: Predictions Using the Optimized 𝜃 Values.
